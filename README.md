Rootd Framework for WordPress
=============================

Rootd is an mu-plugin for WordPress that seeks to provide a better development toolkit. Built on PHP5 OOP principles, and striving to adhere to PSR standards, this framework will allow developers to step into an easier environment for creating plugins and other extensions.

The framework is currently in development (pre-alpha).
